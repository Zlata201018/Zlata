        <h1>Exploring Jupiter</h1>
        <p>
            More recently, this planet has been studied by orbiters, probes, and spacecraft passing by on their way to other worlds. <br/> 
            NASA’s Juno spacecraft currently is studying the giant planet from orbit. <br/>
            Europa Clipper launched on Oct. 14, 2024, to study Jupiter's icy moon, Europa.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            NASA's Pioneer 10 and 11, and Voyager 1 and 2 were the first to fly by Jupiter in the 1970s. <br/> 
            Later, the Galileo spacecraft orbited the gas giant for almost eight years, <br/> 
            and dropped a probe into its atmosphere. Cassini took detailed photos of Jupiter on its way to neighboring Saturn, <br/> 
            as did New Horizons on its journey to Pluto and the Kuiper Belt. <br/> 
            NASA’s Juno spacecraft has been studying Jupiter from orbit since July 2016. <br/> 
            Europa Clipper launched Oct. 14, 2024, to study Jupiter's icy moon, Europa.
