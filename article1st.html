        <h1>About Jupiter</h1>
        <p>Jupiter is a world of extremes. <br/> 
            It's the largest planet in our solar system – if it were a hollow shell, 1,000 Earths could fit inside. <br/>
            It's also the oldest planet, forming from the dust and gases left over from the Sun's formation 4.6 billion years ago. <br/>
            But it has the shortest day in the solar system, taking about 9.9 hours to spin around once on its axis.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Jupiter's signature stripes and swirls are actually cold, windy clouds of ammonia and water, <br/>
            floating in an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. The dark orange stripes are called belts, <br/> 
            while the lighter bands are called zones, and they flow east and west in opposite directions. <br/>
            Jupiter’s iconic Great Red Spot is a giant storm bigger than Earth that has raged for hundreds of years. <br/>

        <h2>Why it's called Jupiter</h2>
        <p>            
            The king of planets was named for Jupiter, king of the gods in Roman mythology. <br/> 
            Most of its moons are also named for mythological characters, <br/> 
            figures associated with Jupiter or his Greek counterpart, Zeus.
